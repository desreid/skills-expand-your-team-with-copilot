## Tips for Writing Good Issues

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Be specific and detailed
- Provide examples when possible
- Include acceptance criteria (what "done" looks like)
- Mention any relevant files or areas of the code
- Explain why the change is needed

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Leave required fields blank
- Assume developers know background context
- Use vague language like "make it better"
- Submit multiple unrelated requests in one issue

## Why Use Templates?

These templates ensure that:
1. **All necessary information** is collected upfront
2. **GitHub Copilot** agents can work on issues without needing clarification
3. **Teachers don't need coding knowledge** to submit clear requests
4. **Development is faster** because requirements are well-defined

## Need Help?

If you're not sure which template to use or need assistance, you can:
- Contact the development team
- Look at the [Documentation](../docs/how-to-develop.md)
- Review closed issues for examples

**Remember:** A well-defined issue is halfway to being solved! Take a few extra minutes to fill out the template completely.
